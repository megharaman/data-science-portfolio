# Data Science & Analytics Portfolio

Hi, I'm Megha â€“ a data scientist with a passion for storytelling through data, and the applications of data science across different fields. This portfolio showcases a selection of my work in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization using Python, R, and various tools.

## Projects

### 1. [McDonalds Sales Forecasting](./projects/mcdonalds-forecasting)
**Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter, k-means, random forest  
Quantifying the sales lost from McDonalds during COVID-19 Pandemic. Utilize a variety of trend-forecasting mythologies and custom segmentation to calculate the potential realized profit during this period.

### 2. [NCAA Basketball Data Analysis](./ncaa-bball-data-analysis)
**Tools:** Python, SQL, Regression, kmeans, HTML  
Analyzed NCAA basketball data to uncover patterns and insights by player and team statistics.

### 3. [NFT Adoption Forecasting](./nft-adoption)
**Tools:** Excel, Statistical Modeling, Time Series Forecasting

To better predict the weekly adoption of NFTs, I utilized CoinBase and LooksRare data to see if I can predict the adoption of NFTs based on a training dataset. The two models developed here are a Pareto II and and Burr XII. Finally utilizing the Burr XII and a few covariances, I get pretty close at accurately predicting the distribution of sales cumulatively and weekly.

### 4. [Oklahoma City Thunder](./oct-data-challenge))
**Tools:** R, ggplot2, RMarkdown, HTML  
Perform EDA and a classification machine learning model on Oklahoma City Thunder players. Utilizing Naive Bayes classification, I predict the future status of players based on performance statistics.

### 5. [Murals in Philadelphia Visualization Guide](./philly-murals-viz)
**Tools:** Tableau, R, Wix 
Junior year of college, I took a class about the Mural Arts Program in Philadelphia. Through that class, I learned about the importance of free, public art, and came to appreciate the effects it has on the surrounding communities. I created this visualization map as a guide to the over 5000 murals in the city!

### 5. [Spotify Data Analysis](./spotify-data)
**Tools:** R, ggplot2, Regression, Time Series Forecasting, Text Mining, K means, LASSO, Predictive Modeling
This deep dive aims to identify what affects the music that we listen to. I analyze a variety of musical attributes and listening history to see if we can identify trends in listening history. Utilizing this data, I created a popularity prediction metric to see based on internal (music factors) and external (namely socioeconomic factors), can I predict what songs will be popular?
